# Shifting non-uniform fast Fourier transform in d dimensions (SNUFFTd)

Implements non-uniform fast Fourier transforms following [1, 2] with
modifications to reduce memory usage. Instead of computing one large fast
Fourier transform on the oversampled grid, the SNUFFTd words on shifted
sub-grids. As a result, no arrays larger than the final output have to be
allocated.

### Instructions

To compile the test executables, run

```bash
make
```

in the shell. They can then be run using:

```bash
test_nufftd_spread
test_sub_snufftd_spread
```

To compile the MEX interfaces, run

```octave
make
```

in the GNU Octave/MATLAB command line. The interfaces are then tested
by running:

```octave
test_snufftd
```
