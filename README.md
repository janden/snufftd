# Shifting non-uniform fast Fourier transform in d dimensions (SNUFFTd)

Implements non-uniform fast Fourier transforms following [1, 2] with
modifications to reduce memory usage. Instead of computing one large fast
Fourier transform on the oversampled grid, the SNUFFTd words on shifted
sub-grids. As a result, no arrays larger than the final output have to be
allocated.
